# Base Converter
I was following "App Ideas" but I thought it would be interesting to increase the project a little.

This repository may be full of grammatical errors, I should be doing it in my native language (Portuguese) but I want to learn English as much as programming, so it is part of the challenge.

## User Stories
* User can enter up to 8 binary digits in one input field
  - I decided not to put a limit because I wanted to see big numbers, maybe I will add a limit later.
* User must be notified if anything other than a 0 or 1 was entered
  - I managed to make the notifications but that's it, the code keeps running even if it's wrong. *And I couldn't fix it, which makes me pissed.*
* User views the results in a single output field containing the decimal (base 10) equivalent of the binary number that was entered
  - After discovering the parseInt(), the code lost its charm so I decided to go further.
## Outcome

I liked doing this project, I learned some things and at some point, I intend to go back to it and maybe add some more features.
